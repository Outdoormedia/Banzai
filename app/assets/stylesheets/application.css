/*
 * This is a manifest file that'll be compiled into application.css, which will include all the files
 * listed below.
 *
 * Any CSS and SCSS file within this directory, lib/assets/stylesheets, vendor/assets/stylesheets,
 * or vendor/assets/stylesheets of plugins, if any, can be referenced here using a relative path.
 *
 * You're free to add application-wide styles to this file and they'll appear at the top of the
 * compiled file, but it's generally better to create a new file per style scope.  Actually they can appear
 * anywhere depending on where you put require_self.
 *
 * (Rob's note: it's generally better to load this stuff at the end, because
 * you'll want to use this file to do specific overrides of styles that have 
 * come before.)
